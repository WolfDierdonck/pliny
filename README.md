## Developing

First, you need to create a .env file. You can just copy the .env_template file, and replace the placeholders with the actual values.

Then, make sure you have both the `pylint` and `mypy type checker` extensions installed and turned on (both official from Microsoft).
When you don't have any unused variables/untyped variables, it should automatically give a warning/error.

You can run the program with `python3 main.py` from the root project directory.
